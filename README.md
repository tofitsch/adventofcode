# Solutions to 2022 advent of code

[adevent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/)

Each day has a folder with 4 files in it:

 1. `input.txt` : the input data
 2. `solution.txt` : the true solutions of part1 (line 1) and part2 (line 2)
 3. `solution_part1.awk` : the script computing the solution to part1
 4. `solution_part2.awk` : the script computing the solution to part2

The scripts return just the solution, no other printout. They are written in `AWK` and executed like:

```shell
awk -f solution_part1.awk input.txt
```
